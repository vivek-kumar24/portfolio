# Mortgage Default Prediction using Machine Learning and Explainable AI

## Overview  
Developed a robust and interpretable machine learning model to predict mortgage loan defaults using the **Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance dataset** (Q1â€“Q3 2024). The project focused on balancing predictive accuracy with model explainability to ensure transparency in financial decision-making.

## Problem Statement  
Early identification of high-risk loans is critical for financial institutions to reduce losses and improve credit strategies. Traditional methods often lack scalability and interpretability.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Size:** ~40,000 records, 110 original features (reduced to 12 after preprocessing and feature selection)
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, binary target creation (`default`), feature scaling, and **SMOTE** for class imbalance
- **Models Used:**
  - **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
    *(XGBoost best performer: F1 = 0.93, ROC-AUC = 0.98)*
  - **Deep Learning:** ANN and CNN  
    *(ANN with SMOTE performed strongly)*
- **Explainability:**
  - **SHAP** used to identify key drivers of default predictions  
  - Important features: `LOAN_AGE`, `CURRENT_UPB`, `OCLTV`  
  - Validated that models relied on financially relevant inputs

## Tech Stack  
**Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Keras**, **SHAP**, **SMOTE**, **Google Colab**

## Outcome  
Created a high-performing, explainable solution ready for integration in real-world financial risk assessment systems. Demonstrated how AI models can be accurate, fair, and interpretable.
